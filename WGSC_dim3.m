% Code that generates Weighted Growing Simplicial Complexes (WGSCs) in dimension d=3 and flavours s=-1,0,1.

% Below we list the output variables and their meanings. We note that the
% full WGSC may be reconstructed from the variables tet_n and w.

% Outputs:
% a adjacency matrix.
% tri_n matrix of nodes (columns) of each triangle (rows).
% tet_n matrix of nodes (columns) of each tetrahedron (rows).
% tet_t matrix of triangles (columns) of each tetrahedron (rows).
% k_30 vector of generalized degrees k_{3,0} of the nodes.
% k_31 matrix of generalized degrees k_{3,1} of the links.  
% k_32 vector of generalized degrees k_{3,2} of the triangles.  
% s_30 vector of generalized degrees k_{3,0} of the nodes.
% s_31 matrix of generalized degrees k_{3,1} of the links.  
% s_32 vector of generalized degrees k_{3,2} of the triangles. 
% w vector of weights of the tetrahedra.
% l_combined combined link data - 1 row per link, 1st column node 1, 2nd
% column node 2, 3rd column generalized degree of link, 4th column
% generalized strength of link.
% t_combined combined triangle data - 1 row per triangle, 1st column node
% 1, 2nd column node 2, 3rd column node 3, 4th column generalized degree of
% triangle, 5th column generalized strength of triangle.

% This code uses: 
% N maximal number of nodes in the NGF
% Flavour of the WGSC s=-1,0,1
% m number of tetrahedra added at each timestep
% mp number of tetrahedra reinforced at each timestep
% h number of nodes in the 'early growth' phase
% figure=1 will save the weighted edge list of the skeleton-network with 
% link-weights given by the generalized strengths of the links in the SC.
